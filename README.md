## What is this?

**1001 Albums Generator MCP** connects AI assistants to your [1001 Albums Generator](https://1001albumsgenerator.com) listening history via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

Instead of manually browsing the website, your AI can retrieve today's album, explore your history, analyze your taste, compare you to the global community, and discover musical relationships — all in natural conversation.

```
You:    What's today's album?
Claude: Today's album is Miles Davis — Kind of Blue (1959).
        One of the most influential jazz recordings ever made,
        featuring Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, and Bill Evans.
        Community rating: ★ 4.63 / 5
```

## 🚀 Installation

### Option A — Claude Desktop Extension _(recommended)_

The easiest way. No Node.js required for the remote version.

1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/bnm12/1001-albums-generator-mcp/releases)
2. Download the right `.dxt` file:

| File           | Description                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `*-remote.dxt` | Connects to the hosted server — zero local setup |
| `*.dxt`        | Runs the MCP server locally on your machine      |

3. Open **Claude Desktop → Settings → Extensions**
4. Drag and drop the `.dxt` file into the window

---

### Option B — Remote HTTP Server _(no install)_

Point any MCP client directly at the hosted server:

```
https://1001-albums-mcp.bnm12.dk/mcp
```

**Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "1001-albums": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://1001-albums-mcp.bnm12.dk/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Option C — Local Installation

**Requirements:** Node.js 18+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bnm12/1001-albums-generator-mcp.git
cd 1001-albums-generator-mcp
npm install && npm run build
```

**Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "1001-albums": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/dist/index.js"],
      "env": { "MCP_MODE": "stdio" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Run as an HTTP server** (for use with any MCP client over HTTP):

```bash
MCP_MODE=sse PORT=3000 node dist/index.js
# MCP endpoint: http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

Restart Claude Desktop after any config change.

| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `refresh_data` | Force-refresh cached data (`global`, `user`, `project`, `group`, or `all`) |

> **Note on `get_review_insights`:** This tool uses MCP Sampling and requires the
> connected client to declare sampling capability. Claude Desktop supports sampling.
> Clients that do not support sampling receive a fallback response with raw review text.

> **Note on detail vs. list tools:** List and search tools return a slim format — no reviews, streaming IDs, or images — to keep responses concise. Call `get_album_detail` when you need a written review, a Spotify/Apple Music link, or full genre breakdown.

## 🏗 Architecture

┌─────────────────────────┐
│     AI Assistant        │  Claude / any MCP client
└────────────┬────────────┘
             │ MCP (stdio or HTTP)

```

The server enforces a **20-second minimum interval** between API requests and caches responses for **4 hours** to stay well within the upstream rate limit of 3 requests/minute.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions welcome. Some ideas:

- New MCP tools (recommendation engine, genre clustering)
- Deeper album analysis (mood inference, BPM/key data)
- Visual listening stats

### Quality requirements (lint + typecheck)

Before opening a PR, run these checks locally:

```bash
# Required: strict TypeScript checks
npx tsc --noEmit

# Required: ESLint (uses the repo's eslint.config.js)
npm install --no-save --no-package-lock eslint @eslint/js typescript-eslint
npx eslint .

# Existing project checks
npm run build
npm test
```

Requirements:

- Node.js 20+ (matches CI)
- npm 10+
- Internet access for one-off lint dependency install (`npm install --no-save ...`) unless already installed

```bash
# Standard workflow
git fork → branch → commit → pull request
```

When adding tools, register them inside `createMcpServer()` in `src/index.ts` and update this README.
